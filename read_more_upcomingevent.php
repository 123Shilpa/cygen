                <p class="hs_disease_txt">The incidences of lifestyle-related diseases have been rising at a faster rate and many remain unaware of the facts and conditions which lead to them. A number of new cases of diabetes, atherosclerosis, heart disease, and stroke, obesity, and diseases associated with smoking, alcohol, and drug abuse are been noted in the current scenarios. Therefore, to make such individuals aware of the causes, prediction, and prevention of lifestyle-related diseases, our CyGen Group team has been organizing health camps at short time intervals. </p>
                <p class="hs_disease_txt">The camps are held under the guidance of professionals and medical experts who not only informed the patients but also diagnose them. Our camp members have been serving patients since our inception and we are glad to organize such camps in future as well. Our volunteers always keep in touch with such patients and inform them about the ongoing camps and about to hold camps. Besides the pre-registered members, other members can also attend our camps and get an insight about the concurrent health predictions and preventions.</p>
                <p class="hs_disease_txt">According to Dr. Tanushree, founder of CyGen Group “We aim to help more and more individuals by increasing their knowledge about lifestyle related diseases, spreading awareness about the ill-effects of such diseases and how they can cure themselves of such illness”.</p>
                <p class="hs_disease_txt">The camp is dedicated to providing periodical check-ups and assistance for deserving patients suffering from lifestyle-related diseases. Visitors to the camp who are interested in donating blood and other help can contact our team. Our camp also supports doctors who wish to enhance their skills and update their knowledge. </p>
                <p class="hs_disease_txt">Individuals who are interested in attending our camp can mail us at contact@cygengroup.com  and we will update them with the same.</p>
