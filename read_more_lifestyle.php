                <p class="hs_disease_txt">It is a disease associated with the way a person or group of people lives. It can be said that it is caused partly by unhealthy behaviors and partly by other factors. It is so called lifestyle disease because a person's habits, behaviors and practices largely determine whether a person develops a lifestyle disease. Certain habits, behavior and practices such as poor eating habits, inactivity or smoking and factors that we cannot control such as age, gender, and heredity causes such disease. These diseases may even lead to or contribute to the development of other lifestyle diseases. Poor eating habits, late nights, not enough sleep, too much stress, increased consumption of alcohol and cigarettes, and lack of exercise can be counted as the most popular causes of lifestyle diseases. The accumulation of improper lifestyles such as stress, eating habits, smoking, drinking, is the inducement of the lifestyle-related disease. It can be refer to chronic diseases which last for long periods of time and progress slowly. Sometimes, it results in rapid death. However, it is found that lifestyle-related disease could be prevented with balanced lifestyles. The good news is that with just a few precautions, these diseases can be kept at bay. Lifestyle diseases include atherosclerosis, heart disease, and stroke; obesity and type 2 diabetes; and diseases associated with smoking and alcohol and drug abuse.</p>
                <p class="hs_disease_txt">The Global Status Report on Non-communicable Diseases 2010 is the first report on the worldwide epidemic of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases, along with their risk factors and determinants. Non-communicable diseases killed tens of millions of people in 2008, and a large proportion of these deaths occurred before the age of 60, so during the most productive period of life. The magnitude of these diseases continues to rise, especially in low- and middle-income countries. WHO projections show that NCDs will be responsible for a significantly increased total number of deaths in the next decade. NCD deaths are projected to increase by 15% globally between 2010 and 2020 (to 44 million deaths). The greatest increases will be in the WHO regions of Africa, South-East Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean, where they will increase by over 20%.</p>
                <p class="hs_disease_txt">The global status report on Non-communicable Diseases 2014 is the second in a triennial series tracking worldwide progress in prevention and control of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). During 2011–2025, cumulative economic losses due to NCDs under a “business as usual” scenario in low- and middle-income countries have been estimated at US$ 7 trillion. This sum far outweighs the annual US$ 11.2 billion cost of implementing a set of high-impact interventions to reduce the NCD burden.</p>
                <p class="hs_disease_txt">Historically, many NCDs were associated with economic development and were so-called a "diseases of the rich". The burden of non-communicable diseases in developing countries has increased however, with an estimated 80% of the four main types of NCDs — cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes — now occurring in low- and middle-income countries. Action Plan for the Global Strategy for the Prevention and Control of non-communicable Diseases and with two-thirds of people who are affected by diabetes now residing in developing nations, NCD can no longer be considered just a problem affecting affluent estimation of the economic impact of chronic non-communicable diseases in selected countries. New WHO report: deaths from non-communicable diseases on the rise, with developing world hit hardest. As previously stated, in 2008 alone, NCD's were the cause of 63% of deaths worldwide; a number that is expected to raise considerably in the near future if measures are                      not taken. If present growth trends are maintained, by 2020, NCDs will attribute to 7 out of every 10 deaths in developing countries, killing 52 million people annually worldwide by 2030.</p>
